# **IoT-Based Underground Cable Fault Locator**  

This project aims to detect and locate faults in underground power cables using IoT technology. The system continuously monitors cable parameters and identifies faults based on impedance variations. When a fault occurs, the exact location is determined and transmitted to a cloud platform for remote monitoring and quick maintenance response.  

## **How It Works:**  
1. Sensors measure electrical parameters along the cable.  
2. Faults are detected based on changes in resistance or impedance.  
3. The data is processed and sent to an IoT-enabled system.  
4. The exact fault location is displayed on a user interface for quick troubleshooting.  

## **Advantages:**  
- ✅ Real-time fault detection and location tracking  
- ✅ Reduces downtime and maintenance costs  
- ✅ IoT-based remote monitoring for quick response  
- ✅ Increases efficiency in power distribution networks  

This system provides a smart and cost-effective solution for improving underground cable maintenance and reliability.
